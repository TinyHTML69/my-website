<h1> Interrupt Question Past Paper </h1>
<h2> Describe how interrupts are used when a key is pressed on a keyboard.[5] </h2>

<p> -Key press generates the interrupt </p>
<p> -Interrupt given a priority </p>
<p>	-Interrupt is sent to CPU </p>
<p>	-Interrupt is placed in a queue </p>
<p>	-CPU stops current task to service the interrupt … </p>
<p>	-… using an interrupt service routine </p>
<p>	-If key press is highest priority the interrupt is processed </p>

<h2> Describe the role of an interrupt in generating a message on the computer that the paper has
jammed.[4]</h2>

<p> -Printer generates interrupt </p>
<p>	-Interrupt is given a priority </p>
<p>	-Interrupt is queued </p>
<p>	-Interrupt stops CPU from processing current task </p>
<p>	-CPU will service interrupt.. </p>
<p>	-… generating an output message to state there is a paper jam </p>

<h2> Formula for Interrupt Question </h2>

<p> -[Device/Action] generates Interrupt </p>
<p> -Interrupt is given a priority </p>
<p> -Interrupt is sent to CPU </p>
<p> -Interrupt is placed in a queue </p>
<p> -CPU stops current task to service interrupt </p>
<p> -... using an interrupt service routine </p>
<p> -If [Device/Action] is highest priority the interrupt is processed/it generates an output message to [inform something] </p>
